"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow, which carries its own unit and integration tests; this
repository's caller is declarative configuration. These tests parse the
caller with PyYAML and pin the contract it must uphold, so drift
(repointing the pin at a branch, widening permissions, or losing the
layout configuration) fails CI on the pull request rather than
surfacing in a scheduled or manual run.
